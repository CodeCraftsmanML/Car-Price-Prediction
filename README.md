Car Prediction Using Machine Learning 

1.	Problem Statement  
My main objective is to predict the selling price of cars based on various features in the dataset. This prediction aims to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding car transactions.

3.	Dataset Overview
The dataset I am working with includes a wide range of information crucial for predicting car prices. It contains details such as the car's name, manufacturing year, selling price, distance traveled (in kilometers), fuel type, seller type, transmission type, owner details, mileage (fuel efficiency), engine capacity, power output, and seating capacity. This comprehensive dataset forms the basis for training and evaluating my Machine Learning model.

3.	Objective
The primary goal of my project is to develop a robust Machine Learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of cars. This prediction is based on the diverse set of characteristics and features available in the dataset. I aim to provide valuable insights into the market value of cars, assisting buyers and sellers in their decision-making processes.

4.	Methodology
   
i.	Data Preprocessing
a.	Handling Missing Values: I employed techniques such as imputation to address missing values in the dataset, ensuring data completeness.
b.	Feature Engineering: I utilized techniques like rounding for the seat column and mapping car names to brands to enhance the model's predictive power.
c.	Encoding Variables: I applied Ordinal encoder and One-hot encoder to transform categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
d.	Transformation: I used log transformations on numerical features to improve their distribution and handle outliers effectively.

ii.	Data Visualization
a.	Categorical Feature Exploration: I visualized categorical features such as owner and seat distributions using pie charts and count plots to gain insights into their distributions and frequencies.
b.	Numerical Feature Visualization: I utilized histograms, KDE plots, box plots, and Q-Q plots to analyze the distributions of numerical features, detect outliers, and assess their impact on the predictive model.

iii.	Model Building
a.	Ensemble Techniques: I implemented ensemble techniques such as VotingRegressor with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors regressors to leverage the strengths of multiple prediction models.
b.	Training and Evaluation: I trained the machine learning model on the preprocessed data and evaluated its performance using metrics like R-squared score and cross-validation to assess its accuracy, reliability, and generalization capability.

5.	Expected Outcome
The outcome of my project was to develop a Machine Learning model that could accurately predict car prices based on their characteristics. This model provided valuable insights into the market value of cars, enabling buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. The success criteria included achieving a high R-squared score and consistent performance across cross-validation folds, indicating the model's robustness, accuracy, and ability to generalize well to new data.
